## Objective
Write neural network from scratch to deal with a classification problem of handwritten
digits in `MNIST` database.
You may take the files `mnist_loader.py` and `mnist.pkl.gz` from this [repository](https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython). Please read the
documentation in mnist_loader.py to learn how to use it.

It is enough to implement a 2-layer dense neural network and play with some of the
hyperparameters.

However, with a good implementation you may easily take more layers
and experiment with the number of layers as well.

Forward pass and backprogation algorithms must be implemented in your solution using `numpy`.

## Requirements
1. Code:
    - Use NumPy for efficient array operations
    - Add comprehensive docstrings

3. Documentation:
   - Class and method docstrings

4. Code Quality: 
   - Pre-commit checks

## Evaluation Criteria

- Correctness of implementations (80%)
- Quality and clarity of code (20%)

Good luck, and happy coding!
