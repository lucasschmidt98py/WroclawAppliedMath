This assignment consists of two problems focused on implementing and working with a linear regression models using closed-form solutions for the least-square error method.

- **Problem 1:** Implement Linear Regression model with closed-form solution using [src/problem_1.py](src/problem_1.py).
- **Problem 2:** Implement Ridge Regression model using closed-form solution using [src/problem_2.py](src/problem_2.py)


#### Grading criteria
1. Only `numpy` library and `built-in` python modules are allowed to be used while solving the problems.
2. **Functionality** </br>
   Correctness of the implementation will be validated based on the unit tests located in `tests` folder. <br/>  **Note**: All tests can be run locally before submitting the code via [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) command triggered from the terminal or command line.
3. **Code quality** <br/>
   The code must be complaint with the following [Python Enhancement Proposals (PEP)](https://peps.python.org/#introduction):
   - [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) – Style Guide for Python Code
   - [PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) – Docstring Conventions
   - [PEP 484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) - Type Hints

#### Self-reading

1. **[The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)** by *Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman*, **Chapters: 3.2** and **3.4.1**.
